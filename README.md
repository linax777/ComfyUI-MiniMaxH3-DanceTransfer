# ComfyUI MiniMax H3 Dance Transfer

[简体中文](README_CN.md) · English

## Headline feature: lightweight unlimited-length video generation

The plugin splits any target duration into continuous segments and completes them in one ComfyUI
execution: per-segment generation with one shared seed, direct continuation from the previous
AV-latent tail, adaptive Drift-Control video masking, Soft AV audio continuity, overlap removal, and final synchronized assembly. Extend the result by increasing
the segment count—without generic Loop nodes or duplicated sampler chains. Practical length is limited
only by local VRAM, RAM, disk space, and ComfyUI execution limits.

An editable reference-media timeline for ComfyUI's native **MiniMax H3 Reference to Video** workflow. It brings reference videos, paired soundtracks, fixed Guides, standalone images, and standalone audio into one compact editing surface.

> Video-generation agents should read the [Chinese segmented long-video guide](docs/AGENT_LONG_VIDEO_GUIDE_CN.md).

## Highlights

- Multi-clip timeline with move, trim, split, delete, snapping, and numeric positioning.
- Only media intersecting the cyan generation range participates in the current reference or Guide plan.
- Three per-clip modes: `Fixed Guide`, `Editable Reference`, and `Boundary Only`.
- Native text-to-video when no image, video, or audio material is uploaded; the encoder creates the standard empty H3 AV latent from the prompt alone.
- Bound source audio follows video edits and can be disabled independently.
- Silent low-resolution monitoring proxies up to `480×270 / 12fps`.
- Multi-select, external file drop, deletion, and drag reordering for image/audio bins.
- Stable `<Picture N>`, `<Video N>`, and `<Audio N>` ordering from UI to H3 inputs.
- Automatic long-reference segmentation for character replacement and lip-sync with one shared prompt.
- Decode-time resizing to the node's `width × height` for VRAM protection.
- Separate merged outputs for timeline soundtracks and standalone reference audio.
- Timeline state is serialized into the ComfyUI workflow JSON.

## Included nodes

| Node | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Material Planner** | Edits media and outputs a compact H3 plan plus an ordered Omni media bundle. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Omni Media Prompt Bridge** | Sends the bundle to an installed Prompt Rewriter Omni backend and returns only `rewritten_prompt`. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Plan Encoder** | Combines the plan, prompt, CLIP, and VAEs into H3 conditioning and latent outputs. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Expansion** | Creates a lightweight long-video plan from prompt/material ordinals without sampling. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Long Reference Auto Segmentation** | Uses the Material Planner duration to slice one long video and synchronized audio while preserving the selected video purpose and reusing one prompt. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Sampler** | Expands an acyclic graph for direct-latent continuation, masking, sampling, deduplication, and assembly. |
| **MiniMax H3 Dance Timeline Director** | Provides the original all-in-one material-planning and encoding interface. Workflows saved before the namespace rename must migrate their node types. |

The split architecture avoids a ComfyUI dependency cycle:

```text
MiniMax H3 Dance Material Planner ──Omni bundle──> MiniMax H3 Dance Omni Media Prompt Bridge ──rewritten_prompt──> MiniMax H3 Dance Plan Encoder
       └──────────────────────────────────────H3 plan────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────> MiniMax H3 Dance Plan Encoder
```

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/linax777/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-DanceTransfer.git
```

Restart ComfyUI and search for `MiniMax H3 Dance`.

For workflows saved before the node namespace rename, follow the
[node namespace migration guide](docs/NODE_NAMESPACE_MIGRATION.md).

The source UI is English. Simplified Chinese is provided through ComfyUI's official localization
system and follows the language selected in ComfyUI settings; restart or reload the frontend after
changing the locale.

### Requirements

- A recent ComfyUI build with the native MiniMax H3 nodes; `MiniMaxH3AddGuide` is additionally required only when Guides are used.
- MiniMax H3 Ref2VA model, CLIP, video VAE, and audio VAE.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- ComfyUI's `imageio-ffmpeg` package for low-resolution preview proxies.

No extra pip dependency is declared. The plugin uses PyAV, Pillow, NumPy, PyTorch, torchaudio, aiohttp, and imageio-ffmpeg normally included with a compatible ComfyUI installation.

## Example workflows

### 1. Basic timeline workflow

Uses **MiniMax H3 Dance Timeline Director** for direct timeline editing and H3 encoding. It retains the all-in-one interface; workflows saved before the namespace rename must follow the [node namespace migration guide](docs/NODE_NAMESPACE_MIGRATION.md).

### 2. Split planner and encoder

Uses **MiniMax H3 Dance Material Planner + MiniMax H3 Dance Plan Encoder** to separate media preparation from H3 encoding.

### 3. Timeline planning with prompt expansion

Adds **MiniMax-H3 Prompt Rewriter Omni (sees and hears)** so the same ordered media can be inspected while producing an H3 prompt.

> This workflow requires [MiniMax-H3-Prompt-Rewriter-ComfyUI](https://github.com/pytraveler/MiniMax-H3-Prompt-Rewriter-ComfyUI). Follow that project's instructions for model, quantization, and VRAM requirements.

### 4. Plugin-owned unlimited-length video generation

**MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Expansion** only validates prompts, segment count, and media
assignments; it performs no sampling. Connect its plan to **MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Sampler**
to build a standard acyclic graph for direct AV-latent continuation with adaptive Drift-Control video masking and Soft AV audio continuity,
overlap removal, and ordered assembly. Every segment uses the same seed. No generic Loop nodes are required.

### Long-video character replacement and lip sync

Place one complete long video in **MiniMax H3 Dance Material Planner**, or use identity pictures plus a standalone
long driving-audio track without video. Connect the plan and one shared prompt to **MiniMax H3 Dance Long Reference Auto Segmentation**, then connect its output directly to **MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Sampler**. **MiniMax H3 Dance Finite Segment Expansion** and manually repeated prompts are not required.

The node does not use the cyan single-run selection as its total range. An image-plus-audio plan follows
the longest standalone audio. When video and standalone audio coexist, the longer available duration sets
the total range, and the shorter medium stops participating after it ends instead of being looped or frozen.
At most one timeline video is accepted. Each segment inherits its generation duration from **MiniMax H3 Dance Material Planner**. Every video window
preserves the source video's selected **Fixed Guide**, **Editable Reference**, or **Boundary Only** purpose.
Use Editable Reference for character replacement; Fixed Guide intentionally anchors the original frames
and will usually prevent replacement. Images retain their order in every segment. With **Slice Standalone
Audio** enabled, long audio follows the same source offsets and overlaps for lip sync; when disabled,
the full audio is reused in every segment as a short timbre reference.

For example, a 60-second source with an approximately 10-second segment duration and a requested
48-frame overlap becomes seven segments with H3's aligned 39-frame overlap. After assembly, any final
H3-grid padding is trimmed back to the exact 1440-frame source duration. Picture, Video, and Audio
ordinals restart at one in every segment, so the same prompt can be reused verbatim.

[Chinese long-reference auto-segmentation guide](docs/LONG_REFERENCE_AUTO_SEGMENT_CN.md)

## Basic usage

1. Set `width`, `height`, and `generation_seconds`.
2. Add video, image, and audio files using the toolbar or direct file drop.
3. Move, trim, or split video clips, then place the cyan range over the interval to generate.
4. Select a purpose for each video:
   - `Fixed Guide` anchors the overlap at its generated-frame positions.
   - `Editable Reference` sends it as `<Video N>` without hard-locking the original subject.
   - `Boundary Only` anchors only the first and last overlap frames.
5. Enable or disable paired video soundtracks as needed.
6. Verify the reference labels at the bottom and run the connected encoder or prompt workflow.

Videos are numbered left-to-right by their intersections with the cyan range. Standalone images and audio follow their visible bin order; drag reordering immediately updates the underlying H3 order.

## Segmented long-video generation

Generate long videos in overlapping segments. Use the previous segment's final shot as the next segment's opening Guide, and describe that overlap as `Shot 1` before new content. When assembling segments, remove the repeated Guide interval from the later segment. See the [Chinese agent guide](docs/AGENT_LONG_VIDEO_GUIDE_CN.md) for the full procedure.

### Finite direct-latent continuation

Finite sampling carries the previous sampled AV latent tail directly into the next opening and
avoids an RGB decode/re-encode round trip. Drift-Control is always active and has no user-facing mode
selector. The requested overlap is aligned down to H3's legal temporal grid (for example, 24 becomes
22 and 48 becomes 39), and that same actual value drives latent carry, decoded trimming, and assembly.
The mask adapts both to the aligned overlap's video-token count and to the connected sampler's sigma
schedule, including accelerated 4-step and 8-step schedules. It dynamically re-noises only the disposable video prefix while keeping the seam-side
latent clean. When audio continuation is enabled, the carried overlap stays exact until its final eight
audio-latent ticks, where a half-cosine Soft AV mask releases it into newly generated sound. Assembly
replaces the preceding audio tail with this incoming Soft AV overlap so the transition is retained in the final output. All segments use
exactly the seed shown on the sampling node. The old generic-loop helper nodes and PR #15923 dependency
have been removed.

Drift-Control AV is adapted from
[ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop](https://github.com/ethanfel/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop)
under GPL-3.0. It remains experimental and is intended for same-shot long-chain comparisons.
